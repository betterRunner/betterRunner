### Hi all developers 👋

I mainly write code in js/ts but also know about c/c++ and python.

Some apps or tools I have built:

- 📚 [Paperly - A paper reader designed for researchers](https://paperly.app), the #1 paper-reader with **WYSIWYG Citation** feature.
- 📝 [Context-Note](https://github.com/betterRunner/context-note), a free open-source note-taking chrome extension that help you **take notes on the web with their context**.
- ⌨️ [Sni-ppet](https://github.com/betterRunner/sni-ppet), a snippet vscode extension: design your own snippets and access them progressively.
- 🎨 [d3-blockchain-model](https://github.com/betterRunner/d3-blockchain-model), a simple visualization blockchain network model inspired by Force-Directed Graph from D3.js.

<!--
**betterRunner/betterRunner** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
